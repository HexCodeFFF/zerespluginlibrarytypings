# Typescript type declarations for [Zack Rauen's BDPluginLibrary AKA Zere's Plugin Library](https://github.com/rauenzi/BDPluginLibrary)

this is probably awful, i just used [tsd-jsdoc](https://github.com/englercj/tsd-jsdoc) and hacked away at it until my
IDE stopped whining at me. i've noticed several instances of incorrect documentation, which means incorrect
autogenerated types. pull requests/issues are Very welcome

[zlib.d.ts](zlib.d.ts) is the file itself, it declares `ZLibrary` as a global variable

you can also import `BasePlugin` from it to
hint ["BDv2 Style Plugins"](https://rauenzi.github.io/BDPluginLibrary/docs/tutorial-getting-started.html#creating-bdv2-style-plugins)
