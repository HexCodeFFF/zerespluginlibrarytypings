# Typescript type declarations for [Zack Rauen's BDPluginLibrary AKA Zere's Plugin Library](https://github.com/rauenzi/BDPluginLibrary)

this is probably awful, i just used [tsd-jsdoc](https://github.com/englercj/tsd-jsdoc) and hacked away at it until my
IDE stopped whining at me. i've noticed several instances of incorrect documentation, which means incorrect
autogenerated types. pull requests/issues are Very welcome
